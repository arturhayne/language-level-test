## About

The main purpose of the system is to provide a language level test for possible students from languages courses. 

A student register himself on the language course website, informing his name, e-mail, password and phone number. Then, the system sends a link to the student's e-mail that redirect him to the test. In the test, the student is presented to grammar, reading, listening and writing questions in several levels. At the final of the teste, the system will show up a report informing the student how many questions he answered right within its levels and the question type.

The questions are registred by the teachers according to the questions type, informing levels and answers.

There is a specific area to define the amount of test questions as well as the amount of questions by type and level. This area just can be accessed by system the administrator.
